<h4> What is Variefy? </h4> 

<p>
  Variefy is an app that generates playlists on Spotify with unfamiliar / fresh music that is similar to a user's current music taste.
Using the K-Means clustering machine learning algorithm, Variefy breaks down a user's top 50 songs into 4 categories, representative of types of songs they listen to. A user chooses to generate a playlist based off one of these 4 categories, receiving a customized music recommendation.
